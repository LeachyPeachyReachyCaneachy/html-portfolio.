<h3>The Godfather 1, 2, and 3 </h3>

<p>The first film was excellent, slightly overrated I thought, but still very good. Part II was the real gem for me. 
    It absolutely lived up to the hype. One of the best character studies I have ever seen. A deeply disturbing 
    Shakespearean tale of a man who, in his attempt to protect his family, ended up destroying it.</p>
    <p>And then... I watched the third film. Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone version specifically. I had heard 
        Part III was not as good as the previous two. I decided to watch the Coda version because it was supposedly 
        Coppola's original vision and a much better cut. But if this is the 'better' cut, then I'd hate to see the 
        original. Let's just say, of all the reactions I expected to have to this film, incredulous laughter was not one of them.
    I did not like the 3rd movie as much as the first 2 but still kind of liked it.</p>
<h3>John Wick 1, 2 , and 3</h3>

<p>John wick 2 is a fantastic movie. The action scenes are great and are very well choreographed and paced. 
    The action never gets too boring and the movie always knows when to take a breather before moving on to the next big scene.
    John wick 3? The exact opposite. People rave on about how the movie is chock filled with a gazillion action scenes but 
    how many of them are actually good? Apart from a few at the beginning(throwing knives scene) the movie feels incredibly slow 
    and sluggish as the action is so clumsy and monotonous completely devoid of any excitement. So many scenes get repeated 
    so many times of John wick doing the exact same move again and again and it never bloody ends. I also don't like how john 
    wick felt so much more sloppy in terms of fighting when compared to John wick 1 and 2.
    Have you seen that final shootout? At the continental when everything goes dark? My god was that absolutely miserable. 
    Another example is the sequence in which he's fighting with halle berry with the crotch munching dogs; this is another scene 
    that definetly outstayed it's welcome.</p>

    <p>In short john wick 3 was a massive disappointment for me and I really hope john wick 4 follows in the footsteps of the first 2 movies instead.</p>
<h3>Goodfellas</h3>

<p>This is my favorite "Mob Film" of all-time. It's a somewhat true story about a real mob family and the people 
    in that family. "Some stories were exaggerated", according to the director and Henry Hill, who was played by 
    Ray Liotta in the film, "but it is still 95% accurate". Joe Pesci's performance as Tommy was incredible. He 
    was my favorite character to be honest, he was extremely violent and sadistic, but also hilarious. Robert De Niro 
    was amazing as usual as Jimmy Conway, he was intimidating when he wanted to be, and then absolutely terrifying on cue. 
    Paul Sorvino played Paulie, who was essentially the boss, or the "Don", and his performance was terrific also because 
    he doesn't try to oversell him being tough, or intimidating, but he absolutely is when the time calls for it. And Ray Liotta, 
    the performance he did in this movie was absolutely, without question, an amazing job. He played Henry Hill so well it's 
    scary he almost makes u think that's how Ray Liotta is in real life. Such a great movie. The story is great, the way it's 
    told is perfect. Martin Scorsese is a genius and he proves it the way this movie plays out. He kept me captivated and 
    wanting more the entire time I watched it. I literally did not want this movie to ever come to an end, I wish it just kept going on. 
    It's lengthy at 2 hours 26 minutes, but every second of it is entertaining. </p>
